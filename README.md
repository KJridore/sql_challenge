# sql_challenge

In the provided task, I began by setting up the schema for a relational database consisting of several tables namely, departments, titles, employees, salaries, dept_emp, and dept_manager. This involved creating each table with the appropriate fields, data types, constraints, and relationships to other tables. For example, the “employees” table was linked to the “titles” table through a foreign key constraint on “emp_title_id”. This helps to ensure the referential integrity of the data. I then proceeded to load data into each table from CSV files using the COPY command, specifying the source file and the target columns for each table.

Following the data engineering tasks, I moved onto performing a series of data analysis tasks using SQL queries to extract meaningful information from the constructed database. I composed a range of queries to retrieve specific sets of data, such as employee details and their corresponding salaries, the details of employees hired in a specific year, and the managers of each department along with their respective details. For instance, I used INNER JOINs to link the “employees” table with the “salaries” table to fetch employee details along with their respective salaries. Similarly, I listed employees in the Sales and Development departments by joining the appropriate tables and filtering the results based on department names.

Lastly, I conducted more intricate analysis by creating queries that filtered and sorted the data to meet specific conditions and requirements, such as listing all employees named Hercules whose last names begin with the letter B, and ranking the frequency of employee last names in descending order. To achieve this, SQL functions like COUNT and ORDER BY were employed, which enabled the summarization and orderly representation of the derived results. For instance, to list the frequency of last names, I grouped the results by last name and ordered them by their frequency in descending order.
